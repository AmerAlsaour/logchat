In the beginning, 
we met to determine what the project is and after agreeing on the idea,
 it was a personal wallet to determine a person's daily expenses and study these expenses over the week, 
month and year, and displays this data in tables and graphs. 
There were evolutionary ideas for it by studying the artificial intelligence of this data and predicting the expenses and alerting the customer. 
 We added an idea that the customer communicates using chat with accountants contracted with Almahfaza website for consultations, 
and these consultations are paid. We reached the creation of the client's bakind and datapoints, 
the account creation page, login and conversation.
 For Frontend, we created the account creation and login page. We created the homepage and corrected the time.
